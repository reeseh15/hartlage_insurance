										<h3>Insurance</h3>
										<p>Tina has been a licensed and practicing insurance agent since for over 30 years. She opened Hartlage Insurance Agency in 2004 as an independent insurance agent to have more freedom in offering the best service to Southeast Wisconsin. Tina currently represents ten insurance companies in order to customize the best policies for her clients.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h3>Taxes</h3>
										<p>I have my accounting degree from UW Parkside, graduated 2001. Worked with my old accountant for 5 years before starting my office tax hours in 2005. I do personal and small business taxes and small payroll services are also offered. I make appts and sit with the client and do the return while they are there, most of the time not needing a return visit.</p>

								<h3>How we got started</h3>
								<p>I began in the insurance industry in 1987 selling annuities and obtained my life, health and property and casualty licenses shortly after that. began working for Equitable Life Insurance Co in late 1987 and worked for them for 2 years, moving to a local bank as their independent insurance agent starting that agency from scratch and worked there for 15 years. In 2004 I moved out of the bank and opened my own office in Union Grove and have been at this office since. While I was working at the bank I went to college to obtain my accounting degree as I wanted to do tax work as well. when I opened my own office, I was able to have 2 offices, one for the insurance side and one for the tax side. This has worked out well for me and I love working in this small community with my very important clients, who have made my business a success.</p>
