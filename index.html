						<p>
						Tina entered the insurance industry in 1987 by selling annuities. Soon after, she obtained her Life, Health, and Property and Casualty Licenses. Tina spent two years with Equitable Life Insurance, Co. before transferring to Community State Bank as their first, local Independent Insurance Agent. During her time at the bank, she pursued her Accounting Degree; successfully graduating with honors in 2001. 
						Following 15 rewarding years at Community State Bank, Tina opened Hartlage Insurance Agency to provide an expanded suite of services to the community. She opened Tina's Tax Service in 2005, and has successfully operated the two offices out of her location on Main St. in Union Grove.
